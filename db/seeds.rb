# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#  students = Student.create([
#      { name: "Thor", age: "7", grade_level: "2nd grade"},
#      { name: "Iron Man", age: "8", grade_level: "3rd grade"},
#      { name: "Hulk", age: "10", grade_level: "5th grade"},
#      { name: "Spider-Man", age: "6", grade_level: "1st grade"}
#  ])
